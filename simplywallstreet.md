* The secret to Simply Wall Streets success is with its user interface model, and allows for a much broader range of fundamental information about liquidity, profitability, earnings and valuation ratios than most stock brokering and market making companies offer. Other market data companies such as Bloomberg and Thompson Reuters have an extensive range of ratios, metrics and financial statements made readily available to mostly institutional clients, however seldom do they offer infographics to the extent Simply Wall Street does.
* All data comes from S&P Global Market Intelligence whcih relates to information around all fundamentals, management and corporate structure and valuation metrics.

* Monthly Active Users is a common concept across subscription based technology companies and Simply Wall Street is no different. Currently there are over 4 million registered users in 170 countries.

* Simply Wall Street appears to be outperforming its competitors and in 2016 bought out its largest competitor capp.io which was a US based rival. Furthermore, the company also has a partnership with NAB which provides a funnel for further onboarding of new users of the app.

## Recommendations
* Advice on what further services Simply Wall Street could make to its expanding customer base would be more around the portfolio management side. Currently the company excels in its data providing services, however being able to see basic risk metrics such as portfolio beta compared to the market and overall sector diversification and correlation between assets.
* Offering this extra service would greatly enhance the users knowledge about risk metrics like overallocation in various sectors and asset classes and further help them to achieve a well balanced equities portfolio
* No real additional technologies would be needed to provide this extra service which would make it a viable option for the company. S&P Intelligence would need to be continually used to gather price action data relating to statistics around risk.
